# Example Site
#### This small example site can be tested by running server.exe. It will listen on the port in the config file, which is 5000 in this example. There are some other settings you can change in the config file which should be pretty self explanatory.
#### the source code is in server.cs. To modify it, put the source files from Shuriken in the same directory, make you changes to server.cs, and compile it with the shuriken source files. Replace server.exe with the compiled result.
